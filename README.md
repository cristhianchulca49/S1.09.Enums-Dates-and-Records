# Java Enums Exercises 📝

Welcome to this Java enums practice repository! These exercises are designed to help you **understand and master enums in Java**, including:

- Creating enums to model real-world concepts  
- Adding methods and logic inside enums  
- Changing behavior based on enum values  
- Converting `String` to enum safely using `valueOf`  
- Handling invalid input and exceptions  
- Writing unit tests to validate enum behavior  

---

## 📚 Exercises

### 1️⃣ Day Enum – Weekday Checker 🌞🌙
**Language:** Java  
- Create an enum named `Day` with all days of the week.  
- Implement a function that receives a `Day` and prints whether it is a **weekday** or **weekend**.  
- Learnings: basic enum creation, switch statements, mapping enum to behavior.

---

### 2️⃣ Level Enum – Task Behavior 🎛️
**Language:** Java  
- Create an enum `Level` with values `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, and `HIGH`.  
- Create a class `Task` with a property `Level`.  
- Demonstrate how the **behavior changes depending on the level**.  
- Learnings: enums as behavior modifiers, dynamic logic based on enum value.

---

### 3️⃣ Advanced Enum Methods – Adding Logic ⚙️
**Language:** Java  
- Add methods inside the `Level` enum, for example `getColor()`, returning a color for each level.  
- Learnings: adding methods and logic inside enums, using enums as mini-classes with behavior.

---

### 4️⃣ String to Enum Conversion – Safe valueOf 🔄
**Language:** Java  
- Convert a `String` to an enum using `valueOf`.  
- Handle errors when the input is not valid.  
- Learnings: parsing user input to enums, exception handling, making enums robust against invalid data.

---

## 🧪 Testing

- All exercises include **JUnit 5 tests** to verify the behavior of enums and classes.  
- Tests cover:  
  - Correct mapping of input values to enum constants  
  - Exception handling for invalid inputs  
  - Behavior changes based on enum levels
